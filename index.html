        <h3>What is the data like ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Two major brands on their global presence (Starbucks & Mcdonalds).
            </li>
            <li>
                Countries which Starbucks source their products
            </li>
            <li>
                No. of restaurants based on the countries (Starbucks & Mcdonalds)
            </li>
            <li>
                Dataset is based on the records from 1987 to 2003
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why must we do this visualization </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                View the amount of Starbucks store being open worldwide from the year 1987 to 2003.
            </li>
            <li>
                Comparison of Mcdonald sales with other major franchises e.g. Taco Bell, Burger King.
            </li>
            <li>
                Able to know which countries has the most Starbucks & Mcdonalds store.
            </li>
            <li>
                Able to know what products Starbucks source from a particular country.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Idiom Evaluation: Method of Representation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Using the size of the circles to indicate the amount of stores in the countries is not feasible as the bigger circles will overlap the smaller ones & misinterpreting values stored in each country.
            </li>
            <li>
                X axis indication of Starbucks stores open over the years is being displayed in the range. Forcing end users to count and find out which specific year they want.
            </li>
            <li>
                Usings icon size to match overall sales when comparing across franchises does not gives much information as they have to refer to the figures labelled above them them.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How (Improving the visualization)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Amount of stores for Starbucks & Mcdonalds. We could use choropleth map with a legend to show the amount of amount of stores for each countries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Comparison of sales between the famous franchises we should use a barchart.
            </li>
            <li>
                Starbucks stores cylinder chart we could use a line graph to visualize the amount of stores open over the years.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tooltip to show additional information from the particular country based on the world map e.g. products they source, no. of stores.
            </li>
        </ul>
